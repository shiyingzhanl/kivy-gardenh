# XCamera: Android-optimized camera widget

XCamera is a widget which extends the standard Kivy Camera widget with more
functionality. In particular:

  1. it displays a "shoot button", which the user can press to take pictures

  2. on Android, it uses the native APIs to take high-quality pictures,
     including features such as auto-focus, high resolution, etc.
